### The XML theme file is located here:

/srv/alfresco-4.2.f/tomcat/webapps/share/WEB-INF/classes/alfresco/site-data/themes/sdcTheme.xml

/srv/alfresco-4.2.f/tomcat/webapps/share/themes/sdcTheme/


### And we had to edit this file to make it all work too:

/srv/alfresco-4.2.f/tomcat/webapps/share/WEB-INF/classes/alfresco/messages/slingshot_en.properties

theme.lightTheme=Light Theme
...
theme.gdocs=Google Docs Theme
+ theme.sdcTheme=SDC Theme
